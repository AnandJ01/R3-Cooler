## SECOND DEMO: Cooling System

### For this second demo we used the Cooler_Relay.ino file to cool down a strofoam box to 44.60 Â°F and show this tempreature on an 3.5' TFT color LCD.
### The Cooler_Relay_IOT.ino file which has WiFi communication with other microcontrollers and our mobile app is the latest revision of the Cooler_Relay.ino file.
