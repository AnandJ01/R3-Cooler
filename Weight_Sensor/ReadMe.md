## FIRST DEMO: Weight Sensing

### For this first demo we used the calibrate.ino file to setup our load cell sensor, and then used the WEIGHT.ino file to actully detect how many 12oz or 16oz cans are on the load cell.
### The WEIGHT_IOT.ino file which has WiFi communication with other microcontrollers and our mobile app is the latest revision of the WEIGHT.ino file.
